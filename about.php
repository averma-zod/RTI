    	Right to Information (RTI) is act of the Parliament of India to provide for setting out<br> 
    	the practical regime of the right to information for citizens and replaces the erstwhile<br> 
    	Freedom of information Act, 2002. Under the provisions of the Act, any citizen of India may request<br> 
    	information from a "public authority" (a body of Government or "instrumentality of State") which is<br> 
    	required to reply expeditiously or within thirty days. The Act also requires every public authority to<br> 
    	computerise their records for wide dissemination and to proactively certain categories of<br>  
    	information so that the citizens need minimum recourse to request for information formally.<br> 
    	<br> <br> 
        This law was passed by Parliament on 15 June 2005 and came fully into force on 12 October 2005. <br> 
        Every day, over 4800 RTI applications are filed. In the first ten years of the commencement of the act<br> 
         over 17,500,000 applications have been filed.<br> <br> <br> 

        Information disclosure in India is restricted by the Official Secrets Act 1923 and various other special<br> 
         laws, which the new RTI Act relaxes. Right to Information codifies a fundamental right of the <br> 
         citizens of India. RTI has proven to be very useful, but is counteracted by the Whistleblowers Act.<br>
